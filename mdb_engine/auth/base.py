Authorization Engine Base Classes

Defines the abstract contract for authorization providers using the Adapter Pattern.
This ensures type safety, fail-closed security, and proper abstraction.

    Abstract Base Class defining the contract for authorization providers.

    Design Principles:
    1. Interface Segregation - Application only needs 'check', not engine internals
    2. Fail-Closed Security - Errors deny access, never grant it
    3. Adapter Pattern - Wraps third-party libraries without modifying them
    4. Type Safety - Clear contracts with proper type hints

    This ABC ensures that all authorization providers:
    - Have a consistent interface
    - Fail securely (deny on error)
    - Provide observability (structured logging)
    - Handle edge cases gracefully
