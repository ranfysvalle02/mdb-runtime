"""
Shared MongoDB Connection Pool Manager

Provides a singleton MongoDB connection pool manager for sharing database
connections efficiently across multiple components in the same process.
This prevents each component from creating its own connection pool, reducing
total connections and improving resource utilization.

This module implements a thread-safe singleton pattern that ensures all
components in the same process share a single MongoDB client instance with
a reasonable connection pool size.

This module is part of MDB_ENGINE - MongoDB Engine.

Usage:
    from mdb_engine.database import get_shared_mongo_client, get_pool_metrics

    client = get_shared_mongo_client(mongo_uri)
    db = client[db_name]
    metrics = await get_pool_metrics()  # Monitor pool usage
