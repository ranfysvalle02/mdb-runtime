# Configuration Files

This directory contains project configuration files.

## Files

- Configuration files for development tools
- Environment-specific settings

## Note

Currently, configuration files are kept in the project root (`.flake8`, `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml`) following Python project conventions. This directory is reserved for future configuration organization if needed.
