# MDB Engine Documentation

Welcome to the MDB Engine documentation. This directory contains comprehensive documentation for developers, contributors, and users.

## 🎯 Start Here: manifest.json

**`manifest.json` is the key to everything.** It's a single configuration file that defines your app's identity, data structure, authentication, indexes, and services. Everything in mdb-engine flows from your manifest.json.

### Essential Reading

1. **[Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md)** ⭐ **START HERE** - Learn how manifest.json works and get your first app running
2. **[Manifest Reference](MANIFEST_REFERENCE.md)** 📖 - Complete reference for all manifest.json fields and configurations
3. **[Manifest Deep Dive](MANIFEST_DEEP_DIVE.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of manifest.json, its convenience, and incremental adoption

### Understanding manifest.json

- **Minimal**: Start with just `slug`, `name`, and `schema_version`
- **Powerful**: Add indexes, auth, AI services, WebSockets as needed
- **Automatic**: Everything configured from your manifest.json automatically
- **Version Controlled**: Your entire app config in one file
