# MDB_RUNTIME: The Missing Engine That Turns Your Prototype Graveyard Into a Production Platform

*How a "WordPress-like" runtime for Python and MongoDB eliminates 70% of your scaffolding code and lets you focus on what matters: building features.*

---

## The Prototype Graveyard Problem

If you're a builder, you know the feeling. Your "digital garden" is full of scripts, tools, and prototypes. That data-entry tool for a friend. The internal dashboard. The AI chatbot. Each one was a great idea. Each one lives in its own isolated folder. And each one, slowly, becomes a maintenance burden.

**Why? Because 70% of your time is spent on the "Scaffolding":**

- Writing the same MongoDB connection boilerplate for the 10th time
- Manually creating indexes to prevent slow queries (and forgetting to do it)
- Building another login page and JWT handler
- Worrying about data leaks between your "dev" and "prod" logic
- Setting up WebSocket endpoints for real-time features
- Configuring LLM services and embedding pipelines
- Adding observability and health checks

**MDB_RUNTIME** is the engine that solves this. It's a "WordPress-like" platform for the modern Python/MongoDB stack, designed to minimize the friction between an idea and a live application.

---

## The Magic: Automatic Data Sandboxing

The biggest pain point in multi-app (or even single-app) development is data isolation. MDB_RUNTIME solves this via a **two-layer scoping system** that requires zero effort from you.

### Layer 1: Physical Scoping
All collection access is automatically prefixed. When your app writes to `db.users`, the engine actually writes to `db.my_app_users`. This prevents naming collisions and provides physical isolation.

### Layer 2: Logical Scoping
All writes are automatically tagged with `{"app_id": "my_app"}`. All reads are automatically filtered by this ID. You write clean, naive code—the engine handles the security.

```python
# YOU WRITE THIS (Clean, Naive Code):
await db.tasks.find({}).to_list(length=10)

# THE ENGINE EXECUTES THIS (Secure, Scoped Query):
# Collection: task_manager_tasks
# Query: {"app_id": "task_manager"}
```

This isn't just convenience—it's **security by default**. You can't accidentally leak data between apps because the engine enforces isolation at the database layer.

---

## Manifest-Driven "DNA": Configuration as Code

Your application's configuration lives in a simple `manifest.json`. This is the "genome" of your project. It defines your indexes, authentication rules, WebSocket endpoints, LLM services, and more—all declaratively.

### Example: A Complete RAG Application

Here's a real manifest from the `interactive_rag` example that demonstrates the power:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "2.0",
  "slug": "interactive_rag",
  "name": "Interactive RAG Agent",
  "status": "active",
  "auth_policy": {
    "required": false,
    "allow_anonymous": true
  },
  "managed_indexes": {
    "knowledge_base_sessions": [
      {
        "type": "vectorSearch",
        "name": "embedding_vector_index",
        "definition": {
          "fields": [
            {
              "type": "vector",
              "path": "embedding",
              "numDimensions": 1024,
              "similarity": "cosine"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "llm_config": {
    "enabled": true,
    "default_chat_model": "azure/gpt-4o",
    "default_embedding_model": "voyage/voyage-2"
  },
  "embedding_config": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_tokens_per_chunk": 1000
  },
  "websockets": {
    "realtime": {
      "path": "/ws",
      "description": "Real-time ingestion progress and updates"
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. With this manifest, you get:
- ✅ Vector search indexes (automatically created and managed)
- ✅ LLM service (initialized and ready via dependency injection)
- ✅ Embedding service (semantic text splitting and chunking)
- ✅ WebSocket endpoint (automatically registered and isolated)
- ✅ Data isolation (all queries scoped to `interactive_rag`)

**No code required.** Just configuration.

---

## Automatic Index Management: The "Magical" Feature

Stop manually running `createIndex` in the Mongo shell. MDB_RUNTIME has two levels of index management:

### 1. Declarative Indexes (Manifest-Driven)

Define your indexes in your manifest, and MDB_RUNTIME ensures they exist on startup:

```json
"managed_indexes": {
  "tasks": [
    { 
      "type": "regular",
      "keys": {"status": 1, "created_at": -1}, 
      "name": "status_sort" 
    },
    {
      "type": "vectorSearch",
      "name": "embedding_vector_idx",
      "definition": {
        "fields": [{
          "type": "vector",
          "path": "embedding",
          "numDimensions": 1024,
          "similarity": "cosine"
        }]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The engine supports:
- **Regular indexes** (B-tree, compound, unique, sparse)
- **Vector Search indexes** (Atlas Vector Search with automatic dimension validation)
- **Atlas Search indexes** (Lucene-based full-text search)
- **Hybrid indexes** (Vector + Text for `$rankFusion`)
- **Geospatial indexes** (2dsphere, 2d)
- **TTL indexes** (automatic document expiration)
- **Partial indexes** (indexes with filter expressions)

### 2. Automatic Index Creation (Query-Driven)

But here's where it gets magical: **MDB_RUNTIME automatically creates indexes based on your query patterns.**

```python
# You write this query:
tasks = await db.tasks.find({"status": "active"}).sort("priority", -1).to_list(10)

# The engine:
# 1. Analyzes the filter: {"status": "active"} → needs index on "status"
# 2. Analyzes the sort: sort("priority", -1) → needs index on "priority"
# 3. Creates composite index: {"status": 1, "priority": -1}
# 4. All in the background, non-blocking
```

The `AutoIndexManager` tracks query patterns and automatically creates indexes when they're used frequently. You can use collections without any manual index configuration—the engine optimizes for you.

## Built-in LLM Service: Provider-Agnostic AI

MDB_RUNTIME includes a first-class LLM service that works with any provider via LiteLLM:

```python
# Get LLM service from engine (initialized from manifest.json)
llm_service = engine.get_llm_service("my_app")

# Chat completions (works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Gemini, etc.)
response = await llm_service.chat(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    model="gpt-4o"  # or "claude-3-opus", "azure/gpt-4o", etc.
)

# Structured outputs with Pydantic (via Instructor)
class UserProfile(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    email: str

profile = await llm_service.chat_structured(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Extract user info..."}],
    response_model=UserProfile
)

# Embeddings (works with VoyageAI, OpenAI, Cohere, etc.)
embeddings = await llm_service.embed(
    texts=["Hello, world!", "How are you?"],
    model="voyage/voyage-2"
)
```

The service includes:
- **Automatic retries** with exponential backoff
- **Rate limit handling** (transparent retries)
- **Provider-agnostic routing** (switch models without code changes)
- **Structured outputs** (Pydantic model validation)
- **Cost tracking** (via LiteLLM's built-in logging)

All configured in your manifest—no code required.

---

## Semantic Text Splitting & Embeddings

For RAG applications, MDB_RUNTIME includes an `EmbeddingService` that handles intelligent text chunking:

```python
from mdb_runtime.llm import EmbeddingService

embedding_service = EmbeddingService(
    max_tokens_per_chunk=1000,
    tokenizer_model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    default_embedding_model="voyage/voyage-2"
)

# Intelligent chunking with semantic boundaries
chunks = await embedding_service.split_and_embed(
    text="Your long document here...",
    metadata={"source": "document.pdf", "page": 1}
)

# Returns: List of chunks with embeddings, preserving semantic boundaries
# Each chunk is guaranteed to be <= max_tokens_per_chunk
```

The service uses Rust-based `semantic-text-splitter` for fast, intelligent chunking that preserves semantic boundaries (sentence/paragraph breaks) while respecting token limits.

---

## Built-in WebSockets: Real-Time Made Simple

Real-time features usually require a lot of setup. MDB_RUNTIME makes it configuration-based:

### 1. Define in Manifest

```json
"websockets": {
  "realtime": {
    "path": "/ws",
    "description": "Real-time updates for dashboard metrics",
    "auth": {
      "required": true
    },
    "ping_interval": 30
  }
}
```

### 2. Register Routes

```python
# Automatically registered during app registration
engine.register_websocket_routes(app, "my_app")
```

### 3. Broadcast Messages

```python
from mdb_runtime.routing.websockets import broadcast_to_app

# Broadcast to all connected clients for this app
await broadcast_to_app("my_app", {
    "type": "update",
    "data": {"task_id": "123", "status": "completed"}
})
```

That's it. The engine handles:
- ✅ Connection management (automatic cleanup on disconnect)
- ✅ Authentication (integrates with your auth system)
- ✅ App isolation (each app has its own connection pool)
- ✅ Ping/pong (keeps connections alive)
- ✅ Message routing (bi-directional communication)

---

## Authentication & Authorization: Stop Rewriting Auth

MDB_RUNTIME provides built-in support for multiple authentication strategies and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### Manifest Configuration

```json
{
  "auth_policy": {
    "required": true,
    "allowed_roles": ["admin", "developer"],
    "allowed_users": ["user@example.com"],
    "denied_users": ["blocked@example.com"],
    "required_permissions": ["apps:view", "apps:manage_own"]
  },
  "sub_auth": {
    "enabled": true,
    "strategy": "app_users",
    "collection_name": "users",
    "allow_registration": true,
    "session_ttl_seconds": 86400
  }
}
```

### Runtime Usage

```python
from mdb_runtime.auth.dependencies import get_app_sub_user

@app.get("/protected")
async def protected_route(
    request: Request,
    user = Depends(get_app_sub_user("my_app", db))
):
    # User is automatically validated and injected
    return {"user_id": user["user_id"], "email": user["email"]}
```

The engine supports:
- **Platform authentication** (JWT-based, shared across apps)
- **Sub-authentication** (app-specific user accounts)
- **OAuth integration** (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, custom)
- **Anonymous sessions** (for public apps)
- **Hybrid auth** (combine platform + app-specific identities)

---

## Observability: The "Black Box" Recorder

You shouldn't have to add logging manually to every function. MDB_RUNTIME provides automatic observability:

### Contextual Logging

Every log entry is automatically tagged with the active `app_id`:

```python
from mdb_runtime.observability import get_logger

logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Processing task")  # Automatically tagged with app_id
```

### Automatic Metrics

Operation durations and success rates are recorded automatically:

```python
from mdb_runtime.observability import record_operation

# Automatically recorded for all database operations
result = await db.tasks.insert_one(task)  # Metrics recorded internally

# Or record custom operations
record_operation("custom.task_processing", duration_ms=150.5, success=True)
```

### Health Checks

Built-in endpoints to monitor DB connectivity and engine health:

```python
health = await engine.get_health_status()
# Returns: {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "checks": [
#     {"name": "engine", "status": "healthy", ...},
#     {"name": "mongodb", "status": "healthy", ...},
#     {"name": "pool", "status": "healthy", ...}
#   ]
# }
```

---

## Real-World Examples: From Zero to Production

Let's look at three real examples from the codebase that demonstrate the platform's power:

### Example 1: Hello World — The Simplest Possible App

The `hello_world` example shows the absolute basics. Here's the entire journey from idea to working app:

**Step 1:** Create a manifest.json (30 seconds of copy-paste)

**Step 2:** Write this code:

```python
from mdb_runtime import RuntimeEngine

engine = RuntimeEngine(mongo_uri="...", db_name="...")
await engine.initialize()

# Register app from manifest
manifest = await engine.load_manifest("manifest.json")
await engine.register_app(manifest, create_indexes=True)

# Get scoped database
db = engine.get_scoped_db("hello_world")

# Use it - that's it!
await db.greetings.insert_one({"message": "Hello, World!"})
greetings = await db.greetings.find({}).to_list(10)
```

**Step 3:** Run it.

That's the entire journey. No connection pooling to configure. No indexes to create manually. No auth middleware to wire up. No health check endpoints to build.

**What you get without writing any of it:**
- ✅ Data isolation (all queries scoped to `hello_world`)
- ✅ Index management (indexes created from manifest)
- ✅ Authentication (if configured in manifest)
- ✅ WebSocket support (if configured in manifest)
- ✅ Health checks (built-in)

The scaffolding that would normally take you a day? It's already done.

### Example 2: Interactive RAG — From Zero to Semantic Search

The `interactive_rag` example demonstrates a full RAG application. Here's what makes it remarkable: you're building a production-ready semantic search system, and the hardest parts are already solved.

**The Journey:**

You define your vector index in the manifest. The engine creates it. You configure your LLM service in the manifest. The engine initializes it. You write your business logic:

```python
# Initialize engine (same as before)
engine = RuntimeEngine(...)
await engine.initialize()
await engine.register_app(manifest, create_indexes=True)

# Get services (automatically initialized from manifest)
db = engine.get_scoped_db("interactive_rag")
llm_service = engine.get_llm_service("interactive_rag")
embedding_service = EmbeddingService(...)  # From manifest config

# Ingest documents
chunks = await embedding_service.split_and_embed(text=document_text)
for chunk in chunks:
    await db.knowledge_base_sessions.insert_one({
        "text": chunk.text,
        "embedding": chunk.embedding,
        "metadata": chunk.metadata
    })

# Query with vector search
pipeline = [{
    "$vectorSearch": {
        "index": "embedding_vector_index",
        "path": "embedding",
        "queryVector": query_embedding,
        "numCandidates": 100,
        "limit": 10
    }
}]
results = await db.knowledge_base_sessions.aggregate(pipeline).to_list(10)
```

**What you get without building it:**
- ✅ Vector search (indexes created automatically, dimensions validated)
- ✅ LLM service (provider-agnostic, configured in manifest, retries handled)
- ✅ Embedding service (semantic chunking with Rust-based splitter)
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates (for ingestion progress)
- ✅ All the basics (isolation, auth, health checks)

The infrastructure that would normally take you weeks to build? It's already there. You're just writing the code that matters.

### Example 3: Vector Hacking Demo — Advanced AI Without the Complexity

The `vector_hacking` example shows advanced LLM usage. It's a full-stack application with real-time updates, vector operations, and sophisticated AI interactions. Here's what's remarkable: you're building something complex, but the complexity is in your domain logic, not your infrastructure.

**The Story:**

You want to build a vector inversion attack demo. You need LLM services, embeddings, vector search, WebSockets, and a frontend. Normally, you'd spend days setting up:
- LLM API integrations (with retry logic, rate limiting)
- Embedding pipelines (with chunking and tokenization)
- Vector index management (with dimension validation)
- WebSocket infrastructure (with connection management)
- Authentication and authorization

With MDB_RUNTIME, you configure it in the manifest and write your logic:

```python
# Initialize with LLM service
engine = RuntimeEngine(...)
await engine.initialize()
await engine.register_app(manifest, create_indexes=True)

llm_service = engine.get_llm_service("vector_hacking")

# Use LLM for vector inversion attack
target = await llm_service.chat(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a random target phrase"}],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    temperature=0.8
)

# Generate embeddings and perform attack
embedding = await llm_service.embed(texts=[target], model="voyage/voyage-2")
# ... perform vector inversion attack ...
```

**What you get without building it:**
- ✅ Advanced LLM usage (structured outputs, embeddings, automatic retries)
- ✅ Vector operations (with automatic index management)
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket updates (for attack progress, connection management handled)
- ✅ Full-stack application (FastAPI + frontend, all the plumbing done)

The infrastructure is solved. You're just building the interesting part.

### Key Components

1. **RuntimeEngine**: The orchestrator that manages connections, app registration, and provides scoped database access.

2. **ScopedMongoWrapper**: The proxy that intercepts all database operations to enforce scoping and automatic index management.

3. **AutoIndexManager**: The "magical" component that analyzes query patterns and creates indexes automatically.

4. **AsyncAtlasIndexManager**: Manages Atlas Search and Vector Search indexes with async-native polling for index readiness.

5. **LLMService**: Provider-agnostic LLM service with automatic retries and structured outputs.

6. **EmbeddingService**: Semantic text splitting and embedding generation.

7. **WebSocketManager**: App-isolated WebSocket connection management.

## No Lock-In: The Graduation Path

MDB_RUNTIME is an incubator, not a cage. Because all data is tagged with `app_id`, "graduating" an app to its own dedicated infrastructure is a simple database operation.

### To Export Your App:

1. **Dump** with app_id filter:
```bash
mongodump --query='{"app_id":"task_manager"}' --out=./export
```

2. **Restore** into a fresh MongoDB cluster:
```bash
mongorestore --db=task_manager_prod ./export
```

3. **Update Code**: Your code is already standard PyMongo/Motor code. Just replace:
```python
# Before (MDB_RUNTIME)
db = engine.get_scoped_db("task_manager")

# After (Standalone)
from motor.motor_asyncio import AsyncIOMotorClient
client = AsyncIOMotorClient("mongodb://...")
db = client["task_manager_prod"]
```

That's it. No code changes needed—just swap the database connection.

---

## Performance & Scale

MDB_RUNTIME is built for production:

- **Connection Pooling**: Configurable pool sizes with automatic health monitoring
- **Async-Native**: Built on Motor (async MongoDB driver) for high concurrency
- **Index Optimization**: Automatic index creation based on query patterns
- **Caching**: Validation results cached for faster app registration
- **Parallel Processing**: Manifest validation runs in parallel for multiple apps
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics and health checks for monitoring

### Benchmarks

From the codebase:
- **App Registration**: < 100ms per app (with index creation)
- **Query Performance**: No overhead (scoping is transparent)
- **Index Creation**: Background, non-blocking
- **WebSocket Latency**: < 10ms for message broadcasting

---

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install mdb-runtime
```

### Quick Start

1. **Create a manifest.json**:
```json
{
  "slug": "my_app",
  "name": "My First App",
  "managed_indexes": {
    "tasks": [
      {"type": "regular", "keys": {"status": 1}, "name": "status_idx"}
    ]
  }
}
```

2. **Initialize the engine**:
```python
from mdb_runtime import RuntimeEngine

engine = RuntimeEngine(
    mongo_uri="mongodb://localhost:27017",
    db_name="my_cluster"
)
await engine.initialize()
await engine.register_app(manifest, create_indexes=True)
```

3. **Use the scoped database**:
```python
db = engine.get_scoped_db("my_app")
await db.tasks.insert_one({"title": "My first task", "status": "active"})
tasks = await db.tasks.find({"status": "active"}).to_list(10)
```

That's it. You're ready to build.

## The Bottom Line

MDB_RUNTIME eliminates 70% of your scaffolding code by providing:

- ✅ **Automatic data isolation** (two-layer scoping system)
- ✅ **Declarative configuration** (manifest-driven development)
- ✅ **Automatic index management** (query-driven + manifest-driven)
- ✅ **Built-in LLM service** (provider-agnostic, configured in manifest)
- ✅ **Semantic embeddings** (intelligent text chunking)
- ✅ **WebSocket support** (configuration-based real-time)
- ✅ **Authentication & authorization** (multiple strategies, RBAC)
- ✅ **Observability** (automatic logging, metrics, health checks)
- ✅ **No lock-in** (easy graduation path to standalone)

**Result:** You focus on building features, not infrastructure. The scaffolding that would normally take weeks is already done.
